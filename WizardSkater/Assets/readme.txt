Story
==========

Every winter for Christmas, Hogwarts shuts down - students by and large return home, and the halls of the school are 
filled with naught but quietude and the silent movement of ghosts through the rafters. This year is different, however. 
Albus Dumbledore, world-renowned wizard and headmaster of Hogwarts, has decided to take advantage of the school's empty 
state to construct the sickest skate course known to muggle or wizard. Help Dumbledore build the best possible course so 
that he can cut the ice like a pro, taking advantage of unique Hogwarts features such as moving staircases, hidden 
passages and even the resident house-elves!
